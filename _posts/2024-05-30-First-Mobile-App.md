"You say that you are a developer and you don't know how to develop mobile apps?"
This was one of the many thoughts going through my mind.

Since the day I was introduced to programming and software development, I was eager to know how apps are made, how huge web applications are developed, and how they are made available to the public. I Googled everything, read numerous articles, watched countless YouTube videos, and then spent hours wondering how to progress if just getting an introduction took so much time.

Fast forward to the days of COVID-19, my friends [Rabeeh T A](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rabeeh-t-a-93a55817b/), [MUHAMMED AJMAL K A](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammed-ajmal-k-a-664983207/), and I started learning Python and web development (if I remember correctly, it was a course by [Rob Percival](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robpercival21/) on Udemy). I still remember the day we had a meeting on Google Meet to discuss what GitHub is and how it works so we could collaborate on projects.

Years passed, and after taking many courses from CS50 and Coursera, and completing an internship that turned into a flexible remote job at [Blend-ed](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blendxed/), Alhamdulillah (praise be to Allah!), here I am! 

I am happy to share that I have published my first mobile application on Google Play Store, which had been on my bucket list for so long!

Download it from Google Play here: [Adkar Champ | Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zameel7.adkarstreak)
[It is an app for daily adkars (supplications) on which I introduced streaks to make it more engaging]
